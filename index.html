I’m a Christian and I work on computers a lot. Sometimes I even enjoy it.</p><b>What do you do?</b><p>For money, I work as a software engineer on Linux and Zephyr based systems.<br>For free, I enjoy listening to music, reading, cooking, and learning about Jesus.</p><b>“I don’t like your website”</b><p>That’s okay. The internet is incredibly bloated and I don’t want to contribute to the noise. People build entire web-apps just to introduce themselves with a simple “hello.” I think that’s goofy and wasteful. I love design and making things beautiful, but my principles won’t allow me to make this website more than it needs to be. I believe that we deserve a simpler, faster, more accessible internet, so enjoy your stay, but this is all there is 🙂</p><nav><a href=//culp.ae>Projects & Writing</a> • <a href=//mng.is>Friends</a> • <a href=mailto:hello@ntompkins.co>Contact</a></nav></body></html>
